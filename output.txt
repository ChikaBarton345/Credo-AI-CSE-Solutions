Instead of being programmed to complete one task, AI can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions independently. \n\u2022\tGenerative AI is AI which generates content (e.g., images, videos, text, or audio).\nAbout algorithms:  AI uses algorithms, which are rules or instructions to perform specific tasks.  An algorithm may sort a list, search through a dataset, or process if-then statements.  Algorithms are fundamental components of AI, but an algorithm by itself is not AI.  While algorithms follow a fixed set of rules, AI combines algorithms, large datasets, and machine learning (models which enable computers to learn without instruction) to adapt and learn from new data.  By contrast, a system which uses an algorithm to complete a single task is not AI.",
